# UCSC iGEM 2021 - Mathematical Modeling Code and Results

This page includes all code and data used to run our mathematical model simulations of Progenie.

Progenie is introduced to a prokaryotic population via phage then spreads throughout that population via bacterial conjugation, eliminating the target gene from the genome of each cell as it spreads. The success of Progenie is wholly dependent on the extent of that secondary spread. Because of this, we developed a statistical model of the spread of Ï†MINTO through a population of mcherry-expressing *E. coli*. We started with an SEIR model, then modified it to reflect the representative parts and dynamics of our target population.

Our modeling goals included:
  1. Establish optimal parameters that must be met for Progenie spread.
  2. Quantify the proliferation of Progenie in a target mixed population.
  3. Understand the timescales in which Progenie acts.

**Based on our initial model runs, we can conclude that Progenie may be successful at invading, propagating through, and eliminating the mcherry gene from populations of *E. coli* in laboratory settings.**
